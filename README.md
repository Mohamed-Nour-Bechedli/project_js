To implement the Color Changer project, begin by setting up the HTML structure. Create an index.html file with the basic document structure including DOCTYPE, html, head, and body tags. Inside the body, add a container div with an h1 heading titled "Color Changer", followed by a color-box div and a button with the text "Change Color". Next, create a style.css file linked in the HTML head section to style these elements: center the container using flexbox, set fixed dimensions and a default background for the color-box, and style the button to be visually appealing with hover effects. Finally, implement the functionality by creating a script.js file linked before the closing body tag. This JavaScript should wait for DOM content to load, then select the color-box and button elements. Create a getRandomColor() function that generates hexadecimal color codes, and add a click event listener to the button that changes the color-box's background to a random color using your function. This complete implementation provides an interactive color-changing experience with proper separation of HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript behavior.
